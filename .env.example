# AI Service Configuration
# Choose ONE of the following options:

# Option 1: Ollama (for local development only)
# OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b

# Option 2: OpenAI (recommended for Vercel deployment)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Note: The application will automatically detect which service to use
# based on the environment variables you provide.
# For Vercel deployment, use OpenAI as Ollama requires a local server.
